### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Vaidas Lungis,

_PHP developer & Developer advocate_

I started my developer path in 2010. At the day PHP 5.3 was the newest release. Can you imagine, it introduced namespaces? But my first project was running under 5.2. Project had bunch of custom scripts bundled in a look a like framework. Good old functions.php was my favorite. During my first years I written my first API and SDK. It was tight coupled, had god classes and npath complexity issues. 
I gained knowledge not only by solving business challenges, but took time to read books and learn best practices at the time. "Clean code" and "Clean coder" books by Robert C. Martin influenced me the most!

Later on learned about PHPUnit, GIT, unix CLI, server configuration: production and development, faced with performance bottlenecks in code, MySql and system architecture in general. Exploring design patterns and languages like Java and javascript.

In the recent years got involved in Docker containers, continuous integration, quality assurance. 
Term "works on my computer" fades away with every day.
